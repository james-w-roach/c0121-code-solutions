User can sign up:
When the user clicks on "Register now", the render method in auth-form.jsx is run,
changing the hash, button text, and action text. Every time the value changes in either
form text box, the handleChange method changes the corresponsing state property
values. Once submit is pressed, handleSubmit destructures the action property of props,
which is 'sign-up' in this case, and performs a fetch request with method POST. This
destructures the username and password from the request body, creates a hashed password with argon2,
submits the username and hashedpassword into the database, and returns a 201 status code
and the user variable, which contains userId, username, and createdAt. handlesubmit
then switches the window hash to the sign in page because action = "sign-up".

User can sign in:
Similar to signing up, except since action will equal "sign-in," the post function will be different.
In this case, the sign-in app.post function checks the database for a matching username and pw,
assigns the matching pair to the variable user, uses argon2.verify to create a token const variable,
and then sends the token and the user object back in the result. HandleSubmit checks for both, then
passes the result to the onSignIn method.

User can stay signed in:
The user is able to stay signed in because the handleSignIn method of the App class takes the result
passed to the onSignIn method, destructures it into a user and a token variable, then sets the user
property of state to the user variable and puts the token in local storage so refreshing doesn't
sign them out. The componentDidMount method then changes the isAuthorizing property to false once the
user is authorized, and since window.location.hash is '', the home page is rendered.

User can sign out:
The navbar class contains an onClick prop for the sign out button, which uses the handleSignOut method
of the App class as an expression. So once the user clicks sign out, handleSignOut removes the token
from local storage and sets the user property of state to null. Since the user property is falsy now,
the user is then redirected to the sign-in page.
